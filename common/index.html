<p>But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain, you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal.</p>
 
<p>This <strong>piece of text is bold</strong> and here's <em>something in italics</em>. And here is a <a href="/">link about something</a> you should read.</p>
 
<h2>Header level two</h2>
 
<p>Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance - the spinal cord - as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale's spine phrenologically? For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord.</p>

<p>But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the Sperm Whale's hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know. At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific. For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects. While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern.</p>
 
<h3>Lists</h3>
 
<ol>
   <li>The first item.</li>
   <li>The second item is quite long and could very well wrap to two lines if so inclined.</li>
   <li>The third item.</li>
</ol>

<p>When ordered lists are nested, the labeling looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first item on the first level
    <ol>
      <li>The first item on the second level
        <ol>
          <li>The first item on the third level

<h3>Icon Font</h3>

<p>When you want to insert an icon, the markup looks like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;span class=&quot;icon&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; data-icon=&quot;N&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>

<p>Here are what the different values for "data-icon" get you:</p>

<ul>
<li>N = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="N"></span> = next caret</li>
<li>P = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="P"></span> = previous caret</li>
<li>R = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="R"></span> = right arrow</li>
<li>L = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="L"></span> = left arrow</li>
<li>U = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="U"></span> = up arrow</li>
<li>D = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="D"></span> = down arrow</li>
<li>p = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="p"></span> = more icon</li>
<li>m = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="m"></span> = less icon</li>
<li>M = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="M"></span> = menu</li>
<li>X = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="X"></span> = close</li>
<li>A = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="A"></span> = you are not here</li>
<li>B = <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true" data-icon="B"></span> = you are here</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll revise and expand on these as we iterate.</p>
