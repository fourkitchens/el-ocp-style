                <li>This lesson introduces students’ vocabulary notebooks. Allow more time in other parts of the school day to reinforce this important new routine.</li>
                <li>When students work in their vocabulary notebooks, they might not be able to define all the words only in context. Tell them to give it their best guess. When reviewing their vocabulary notebooks, note the words students didn’t know. Out of these, prioritize the one or two most important words for students to know, and define them for the class the next day. Consider using dictionary.com or unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate.htm and projecting the words on the screen for students the next time they work in their vocabulary notebooks, or give them a written definition on chart paper.</li> 
                <li>The purpose of these notebooks is to support students to carefully attend to words. It provides them with repeated opportunities to practice finding the meaning of words in context. The important thing is not that they memorize these words, but that they have a deeper awareness of words they don’t know and strategies to help them find the meaning of any unknown words. There is no need to quiz students.</li> 
                <li>Also create an Interactive Word Wall so that students can refer to these words throughout the unit.</li>

              <h3>A. Mini Lesson: Using Informational Text Features (10 minutes)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Gather students in large group. Remind them that good researchers are also good readers. Say: “One way we are going to become stronger readers is by learning to read the text features in informational books.” Remind students that they looked at some text features in Unit 1, but today they will think about how to use text features to find information efficiently, or quickly. Tell them that they probably already know something about this from previous years in school and from their work during Module 1.</li>
                <li>Project pages 6 and 7 of Everything You Need to Know about Frogs and Other Slippery Creatures. Ask students: “What are some text features you see on this page?” Invite students to Think-Pair-Share.</li>
                <li>Post the Text Feature Scavenger Hunt anchor chart (this should look just like students’ recording forms: see Teaching Note). Cold call a few students to share out with the group. Listen for responses such as: “captions, photographs, etc.” Capture their comments on this chart.</li>
                <li>Point to the close-up of the tadpoles. Ask students about the information they could learn from this text feature. Provide a sentence frame such as: “When I see the ________, I learn_______.” Guide students with an example as needed, such as: “When I look more carefully at this close-up, I realize the tadpoles have yellow and dark spots on them.”</li>
                <li>Say to students: “Sometimes authors provide a close-up, or zoomed-in picture of something, that shows important details. Look carefully at this close-up. Turn and tell a partner what detailed information about tadpoles you learned from this close-up.”</li>
                <li>Invite a few students to share their information aloud. Track their ideas on the Text Feature Scavenger Hunt anchor chart in the box to the right of the heading Close-Up.</li>
                <li>Then, point to caption, the heading below close-up. Again ask students if they know what this feature is and how it helps readers. If they do not know, tell them that a caption gives the reader new information about the image or photograph it goes with.</li>
                <li>Read the caption aloud and ask students to listen for important information. Cold call a few students to share their learning and record their facts in the caption row of the anchor chart.</li>
                <li>Show students the glossary and index at the back of the book and briefly explain the function of each. Say to students: “We learned in Unit 1 that the glossary is like a mini dictionary that helps the reader learn the definition, or meaning, of important words in the text. The index is an alphabetical list of important information in a text with page numbers.” Zoom in on the index and ask students to Think-Pair-Share a topic and page number they see. Provide guidance as necessary, with examples such as: “If I wanted to learn about the American bullfrog, I would turn to page 31. Using the index helps me find the information efficiently because I don’t have to turn to every page in the book.” Invite student questions about the glossary and index, and clarify misunderstandings as necessary.</li>
                <li>Tell students that the table of contents is an important text feature found at the front of some texts. Project the table of contents on page 3. Say to the class: “The table of contents helps the reader identify key topics in the book in the order they are presented.” Ask students to name one topic they might be able to find in this text
                based on the table of contents. Support as needed with a statement such as: “If I wanted to find out the frog’s life cycle, I could go to page 14, because that one is titled ‘Life Cycle of a Frog.’” Tell students that because this book is about frogs and other amphibians, it is especially important to find the frog information in the book so they can continue to build their expertise about freaky frogs.</li>
                <li>As a review, ask students:
                  <blockquote>
                    “What were the three things you saw in this mini lesson?”
                  </blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>Listen for the following:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Find the text feature.</li>
                    <li>Use the text feature to read closely.</li>
                    <li>Track new information on the recording form.</li>
                  </ul>

              <h3>C. Introducing Vocabulary Notebooks (15 minutes)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Ask students to focus whole group. Introduce the vocabulary notebook routine for this unit: “As you know, it is important for readers to build their word power. One way we will do this is by carefully recording important words and definitions in our vocabulary notebooks.” </li>
                <li>Distribute students’ vocabulary notebooks and students’ “Staying Alive: Animal Adaptations” text (from Lesson 1). </li>
                <li>Show students the Vocabulary Notebooks anchor chart (which looks just like their vocabulary notebook page). </li>
                <li>Project the text “Staying Alive: Animal Adaptations.” Direct students to the bold phrase physical adaptations. On the anchor chart, model how to complete each column of the vocabulary notebook:
                  <ol>
                    <li>In Column 1 (Vocabulary Word), write: physical adaptations (and ask students to do the same on their first vocabulary notebook page).</li>
                    <li>Show students how to find the definition in the glossary at the bottom of the text. In Column 2, write the definition. (and give students 1 to 2 minutes to write the glossary definition on their page)</li>
                    <li>Tell students that they should then think about the meaning in their own words. Invite students to turn and tell a partner what physical adaptation means to them. Ask a few students to share out their definition. In Column 3 of the anchor chart, write a simplified version of the definition in Column 2. Students may give a definition such as: “A physical adaptation is something special about an animal’s body that helps it live.”</li>
                    <li>Ask students to draw a picture of what the word means to them in Column 4. Tell them that their drawing doesn’t have to be beautiful: the purpose is to help them remember the word. Give students a couple of minutes to sketch an example, such as a webbed foot or a large eye. </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Ask students to follow the same process with the phrase behavioral adaptation and the word adaptation. Confer with students and provide assistance as needed. </li>
                <li>Tell students that they will use their vocabulary notebooks throughout this unit: “As you read in this unit, you will continue to pay attention to important science words about frogs as well as other important words that will help you as readers. Each time you work in your journal, you will do what we did today on a page in your vocabulary notebook. These vocabulary words will help you build your word power and learn lots of new information about freaky frogs and their adaptations.”</li>
